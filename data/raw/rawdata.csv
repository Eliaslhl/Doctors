"Update: Administrative and official reported coverage data are collected annually through the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form on Immunization (JRF) exercise (occurring in the Q1-Q2 of each year). Country data (including historical data) are updated and made available as received. WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC) national, regional, and global data are updated annually and released in mid-July. "
"Data use: Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030), Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC) / WHO Estimates of Human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization coverage, WHO recommendations, risk assessments, publications, guidance, and strategies."
"Comments: The quality of the estimates are determined by the quality and availability of empirical data. Vaccination is relatively easy to measure and two methods - facility reports (or administrative data) and surveys - have been developed, each of which, when properly designed and implemented, provides accurate and reliable direct measures of coverage levels. Implemented jointly, they provide a validation of coverage levels. However, both methods are subject to biases. In some instances, these biases may be identified and corrected and we have attempted to do so. These data are supplemented with local consultations that often explain inconsistencies and anomalies in the data and provide insight into forces that influence coverage levels. More importantly, WHO and UNICEF are working closely with countries to improve the quality and usefulness of coverage monitoring data systems."
"These estimates should be used alongside the accompanying text that provides additional information regarding each estimate. Please refer to each specific coverage reference tab on the WHO Immunization Data portal to view data limitations, glossary, and metadata. "

"Instructions: Report routine immunization coverage in this table using the administrative method, that is, using data on the number of doses administered. 
 
Include only doses given that are part of the national immunization schedule. Usually this means that these doses are recorded on the recipient's immunization personal record. 
 
Routine immunization may include additional immunization delivery strategies (such as Periodic Intensification of Routine Immunization) or school-based immunization. 
 
Not considered ""routine"" are doses that are given as part of ""supplemental immunization activities"" (SIAs), i.e. doses that are given outside the immunization schedule such as, campaigns where persons receive vaccines regardless of their previous vaccination status. SIAs are usually intended to achieve accelerated disease control goals. SIAs, as well as vitamin A distribution, should be reported in the Supplementary activities topic in the eJRF."

"These data show the latest WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC). They are based on data reported by 25 June 2025. WUENIC estimates include a Grade of Confidence assigned to each estimated data point. The current release of the WUENIC with data up to 2024 (released in 2025) includes estimates for WHO Member States, including those that did not report 2024 data. For these non-reporting countries, estimates were extrapolated from the last point informed by empirical data. Similarly, global and regional coverages, values were extrapolated from 2023 for non-reporting countries. Non-reporting countries represent ≈4% of the global 2024 cohort. WUENIC data time series are updated annually in mid-July based on available reported data and survey results. Please be sure to reference the 2024 revision (completed 15 July 2025) as the data is used."

﻿WHO estimates of Human papillomavirus immunization coverage
"Data source: WHO estimates of Human papillomavirus immunization coverage, 2024 Revision (completed 15 July 2025), data from 2010-2024. These data show the latest HPV Estimates. They are based on data reported until 20 June 2025. "
"The methodology for HPV vaccine coverage estimates was developed by WHO in 2009. Since 2010 the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form collects data on HPV vaccine schedule and doses delivered to females by actual age from 9 to 14 and 15+ year old in order to start calculating coverage measures. Starting 2019 also doses delivered to males, as well as official denominators and coverage estimates are included in the Joint Reporting Form. A cumulative, cohort method to track trends and compare between countries through an indicator of coverage by 15 years of age was identified. In 2018, a further consultation on the topic of HPV coverage measurement identified the need for an additional coverage measure to assess the coverage by schedule in a calendar year. Based on the consensus, a second indicator, called programme performance was established that captured the performance of the programme in the previous calendar year. Both indicators take into account the doses delivered to girls who started the first dose between 9 and 14 years of age and are disaggregated for first and completed dose to account for changes over time in the number of doses in the HPV vaccination schedules. To establish denominators, the methodology uses as a default the UN Population Division county estimates. To deal with the different ways countries set and change eligibility criteria over time, a normalization process is used to translate eligibility into denominators. This includes translating school grade eligibility in population cohorts and dealing with multiple cohort eligibility (changes) over time. The WHO methodology to establish HPV vaccine coverage estimates has been reviewed by the Immunization and Vaccine related Implementation Research Advisory Committee ("

﻿Protection At Birth (PAB) against tetanus with Tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV) 2024 revision
(TT) vaccine (TT protection) Monitoring
1) Background: 
Definition of PAB: The reported Protection at Birth against tetanus (PAB) coverage by WHO and UNICEF is an estimate for a reference year of the percentage of pregnant women protected by tetanus toxoid containing vaccines (TTCV) who would give birth to a child protected against tetanus as a result of maternal transfer of antibodies through the placenta.
"A pregnant woman is considered protected against tetanus if she is still in the period of protection that follows the last dose of TTCV she received during her previous pregnancies or outside of pregnancies (i.e. any TTCV administered in infancy - DTP or Pentavalent), second year of life, school health services, periodic SIAs/ campaigns in high risk areas, post injury, etc.)"
PAB is influenced by the TTCV schedule followed based on the WHO recommendation as the duration of protection is dependent on the number of properly-spaced doses of TTCV received. Six doses of TTCV are recommended if started in infancy while 5 doses are recommended if started in the reproductive age. In terms of protection from tetanus for women starting in the reproductive age:
"-TT protection starts about 15 days after the second dose of TTCV and last for approximately 3 years,"
"-the 3rd dose of TTCV is administered at least 6 months after the second dose and extends the protection to about 5 years,"
-the 4th dose should be administered at least one year after the 3rd dose and protects for at least 10 years
"-the 5th dose administered at least 1 year after the 4th dose and protects throughout the reproductive age, and probably for life."
"Consequently, monitoring the level of PAB is a complex process given the various opportunities for a woman to receive doses of TTCV vaccine and the absence of permanent record for all doses ever administered makes it even more complex."
2) The source of information to estimate PAB and their respective accuracy challenges.
"-Administrative reporting: Countries routinely submit yearly report on TT2+ coverage data through the health management information system (HIMS). TT2+ represents the number of protective doses of TTCV (TT2 + TT3 + TT4 + TT5) given to pregnant women over the last 12 months divided by the number of pregnant women in the population (annual target). This method tends to underestimate TT protection as evidenced by many coverage and TT sero surveys, and some of the reasons for the underestimation include:"
--Incomplete and delayed reporting from health facilities for the previous year and non-incorporation of delayed reports in the HIMS.
--Many pregnant women who have received 5 TTCV doses and do not need further doses are not included in the numerator while protected. This underestimates the level of tetanus protection affecting a growing number of well performing countries. 
"--The History of previous TTCV doses even during past pregnancies are often not taken into account by health workers at antenatal care (ANC) clinics in absence of documentation and the TTCV vaccination schedule is reinitiated. Reviews of immunization registers in ANC clinics and EPI centres that have been running for over 20 years have shown excessively low number of 3rd, 4th and 5th doses administered.  "
"--Most often the reporting excludes TTCV doses administered outside of pregnancies (campaign doses in high risk areas, MenA vaccine doses (in sub-Saharan African meningitis belt countries as the vaccine uses TT as a carrier protein), school TT doses, post injury dose, early infant TTCV dose such as DTP or pentavalent and TTCV doses administered by the private sector)."
--In many countries number of expected pregnant women is often the results of projected data based upon an old census and leads to inaccurate denominators resulting in flaws in reported TT2+ coverage.
"-TT coverage surveys: TT protection by at least 2 doses is usually assessed as part of EPI coverage surveys, MICS and DHS, taking into account the history of TTCV doses administered during and outside pregnancies (TT SIAs, school-based doses). Those surveys are usually conducted with 3 to 5 years’ intervals. They usually show a higher level of TT protection than the administrative routine reporting of TT2+ coverage if well planned and executed. However, surveys have suffered from few challenges including:"
--Some bias may occur when coverage surveys are carried out or influenced by EPI staff.
--An over reliance on the history of TT doses administered due to poor retention of documented evidence of past TT doses administered during successive pregnancies and outside pregnancies (campaign doses) may seriously underestimate true TT protection (as evidenced in comparative Ethiopia coverage surveys DHS vs EPI).  
"--Exclusion of valid doses of TTCV administered in infancy and, most recently, exclusion of doses of MenA  administered successfully in sub-Saharan African countries."
"--They are dependent on good planning including sampling, quality execution and quality supervision of the survey. The long questionnaires in the DHS survey may lead to respondent’s fatigue and influence the responses."
"--DHS and MICS survey protocols vary from one country to another with regard to TT protection assessment method and sometimes only look at pregnant women in last 3 years having received one or two doses of TTCV, ignoring previous TTCV doses administered during and outside pregnancies."
"--Results of coverage surveys have systematically shown to be lower than sero surveys results (Burundi[1], CAR[2], Haiti)   "
"-Routine administrative monitoring of Protection At Birth (PAB) methodology assessed at DTP1 immunization contact: This method uses infant immunization registers to routinely assess TT protection based on history of TT doses administered during past pregnancies and outside pregnancies (TT SIAs), and has proved much more accurate than the classic administrative method of TT2+ reporting specially in few well performing countries like Tunisia, Morocco and Syria When it was initiated in the late 1990s. However, it has faced few challenges:"
--It has only been adopted nationwide by few well performing countries because it requires a high level of health worker training and supervision during early implementation to ensure quality of the assessment.
--It is dependent on good retention of card(s) or reliable immunization history
--It can only bring PAB coverage up to at least DTP1 levels which is frequently over 80% in many countries except in high risk areas targeted by TT SIAs to eliminate MNT where coverage for DTP1 may be low.
--To be valuable it requires effective nationwide implementation.

"Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2002, 80 (9)"
"While most of the countries that currently routinely monitor PAB do so, during DTP1 immunization contact, all post-natal care visits (currently recommended at 24 hours, day 3, and between 7–14 days and 6 weeks after delivery) present an opportunity to check PAB. With the increased integration of maternal, post-natal and vaccination services there are other contact opportunities where PAB status could be assessed and recorded"
"-Results of TT protection levels obtained from MNTE validation surveys: The Lot Quality Assurance – Cluster Sampling survey conducted to validate the elimination of MNT is implemented in the least performing district of a country as regards risk indicators for MNT. This validation survey includes an assessment of TT protection through the history of TT doses during and outside of pregnancies and relies on an in-depth training and supervision of interviewers. The results can be used as a useful proxy indicator of the country’s PAB protection performance as the survey is carried out in the least performing district of the country. However,"
--The nationwide TT protection level can be even higher than that of the LQA district that often has poorest EPI and routine TT coverage.
"--The least performing district has often been targeted by TT SIAs, which may not be a true reflection of nationwide TT protection if TT SIAs have been the main reason for TT coverage achievements.  "
"-Results of TT SIAS (2 or 3 rounds, or one periodic corrective round) targeting women of reproductive age in high risk districts: TT SIAs are conducted in identified high risk districts (reporting less than 80% TT2+ coverage, and less than 70% skilled birth attendance coverage). In few countries a nationwide exercise was conducted (i.e. Angola, Burkina Faso, Chad , Cote d’Ivoire, DRC, Laos, Liberia, Niger, PNG, Sierra Leone,  Timor Leste) and periodic TT SIAs’ corrective rounds are conducted to sustain and provide long lasting TT protection where the health system is still not performing well. The proportion of country population targeted by TT SIAs and TT2 SIAs’ coverage achievements in WRA can be used to adjust overall country PAB performance among pregnant women. However,"
--Sometimes the administrative reports of TT SIAs performance may be inaccurate due to the classic denominator issues.
--Some countries report coverage by round of SIAs instead of by doses of TT received.
--Duration of TT Protection following TT SIAs and periodic additional TT SIA doses  is usually a conservative estimate as the SIAs target high risk areas where WRAs may still have up to 70% TT protection from routinely administrated doses for which there are no records. . Therefore the duration of protection following TT SIAs’ doses may be much longer as the number of TTCV doses ever received may be incorrect.
"-Results of MenA campaign in Sub-Saharan African countries: MenA vaccination campaigns have been very successful in providing one dose of TT to those 29 years and below including females. It acts as a TT booster dose for WRA targeted by TT SIAs in high risk areas of underperforming countries (Chad, Mali, Niger, etc.) providing a longer TT immunity to those who already received previous doses including in areas unable to establish a strong routine TTCV programme. However, The impact of MenA vaccination may be more important in delivering an additional high coverage 3rd dose in high risk areas as the 3rd dose coverage is often the lowest during TTCV SIAs."
"-Results of TT sero surveys: TT sero surveys’ results are the most precise and reliable markers of PAB protection as they include the benefits of any doses of TTCV administered since infancy that no other method can account for. Sero surveys do not rely on history of TTCV doses administered, and account for possible poor quality of TT vaccine. They have systematically revealed higher protection levels than TT coverage surveys and are higher than administratively reported PAB (Burundi1, CAR2, Haiti). Similar higher difference in protection levels have been documented at district level in Uganda and Kenya. "
"Serology will be the most appropriate tool to monitor TT protection nationwide in the future if incorporated into EPI coverage survey, MICS or DHS. "
"Unfortunately, very few countries have carried out sero surveys due to high cost, limited technical capacity implications and absence of clearance from the MICS and DHS teams. "
"-PAB modeling created by WHO in early 2003 to estimate PAB for each country: The model was designed to accommodate the benefits of all doses of TTCV administered during infancy (DTP containing vaccines), during pregnancies and during TT SIAs, and duration of protection following each subsequent dose. However, in many low income and lower middle income countries the model produced PAB coverage estimates substantially inconsistent (too high or too low) and deviant from all other sources of information including coverage surveys, sero surveys and other programmatic evidences. One of the key limitations of the model was the failure to accommodate history of all TTCV doses by district where populations at risk have been reached by TT SIAs. The modelling method was later abandoned. "
3) History of methods used and current approach used to monitor and report PAB
The methodology to estimate PAB did evolve over time with the progressive implementation of the WHO recommended 5 dose TTCV schedule and implementation of 3 rounds of TT SIAS in high risk districts of many countries.
"-From 1986 to 1989: the administrative reporting of TT2+ was used. Most countries had the policy to administer 2 doses of TT in each pregnancy at the time, and TT SIAs in high risk districts were not yet implemented as a strategy to eliminate MNT. Results of nationwide TT coverage surveys were used over administrative reports as they did overcome the weakness of poor data quality - incomplete and over reporting. "
"-From 1990 to 2003.  The WHO recommended 5 doses policy was introduced in most countries and TT SIAs targeting WRA took place yearly in many low and lower middle income countries. EPI coverage evaluation survey (CES) and MICS/DHS methods for TT coverage assessment were amended to take into account all doses of TTCV administered during pregnancies and during SIAs. However, many DHS and MICS did not always follow through the WHO recommended survey protocol."
"The routine PAB monitoring at DTP1 contact methodology was introduced in the late 1990s to improve the quality of TT protection data as better performing countries started reporting lower coverage using the TT2+ coverage monitoring method. However, only few countries applied it successfully nationwide. "
During those years the method used by WHO and UNICEF to report national level TT2+ coverage estimates for each country was the result of the reported administrative TT2+ coverage data adjusted with the reported TT SIAs coverage achieved.
"Each Protocol and results of nationwide EPI CES /MICS/DHS coverage survey results for tetanus protection were reviewed by WHO and UNICEF in consultation with country EPI managers. Where the surveys include the history of TT doses during past pregnancies and TT SIAs, the coverage results were used to report PAB estimate overriding administrative method mentioned above."
"Where survey data was not available, the reported administrative PAB coverage in the few countries that implemented this method nationwide was used. "
The review also took into account MNTE status and TT coverage survey results in the worst performing district(s) as surrogate information for the whole country to back up reported or surveyed estimates.
2003- 2017: UNICEF and WHO continue to use and review and compare the multiple data sources available as mentioned for the 1990 to 2003 period:
1) Administrative reporting of TT2+ dose (unfortunately this excludes the growing contribution of the private sector and post injury doses) 
2) Most recent validated EPI CES/MICS/DHS results after review of the protocol /questionnaire (the survey usually include the private sector contribution)
"3) TT SIAs coverage results, timing, duration of protection and proportion of the population covered by TT SIAs over time"
"4) Routine PAB monitoring at DTP1 contact method when reliable data is available, as obtained from Morocco and Tunisia "
5) TT2+ coverage results in worst performing district(s) during MNTE LQA validation surveys
"6) Surrogate EPI programme performance indicators such as DTP1 , DTP3, coverage and expert opinion. Reproductive health indicators like antenatal care (ANC) and skilled birth attendance (SBA) that are directly linked to tetanus protection are factored in MNTE validation assessments.  "
7) Previous 3 years reported estimates for EPI coverage to accommodate incomplete reporting of last previous year 
Following the data review the final PAB estimate is a consensus between WHO and UNICEF technical staff and rational for each country data is incorporated.
"The current reported PAB estimates based on TTCV protection are still very likely underestimating the true level of tetanus protection in some countries because historical doses of TTCV including childhood doses, 2nd year of life booster doses, school-based doses, MenA vaccine doses and post injury doses, and recently, in some countries, doses given for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) etc. are not systematically documented and/or included in the estimates."
